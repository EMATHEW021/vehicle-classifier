In South Africa, the department of transport issues different driving licenses depending on the 
category (or categories) of vehicle that the recipient wishes to drive (or learn to drive).
How is a vehicle classified? It depends on the Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM), and on whether the vehicle 
is ‘articulated’, or whether a trailer is being towed. 
The GVM dictates the base class to which the vehicle belongs: B, C1, or C.
GVM≤3500 Class B
3500<GVM≤16000 Class C1
16000<GVM Class C
If, however, the vehicle is articulated, or is towing a trailer with a GVM greater than 750kg, then it 
belongs in an extended, ‘E’, version of the class: EB, EC1, or EC. (According to Wikipedia, an 
articulated vehicle is one “which has a permanent or semi-permanent pivoting joint in its 
construction”.)

The classification scheme does not allow for an articulated vehicle towing a trailer. It’s an ‘eitheror’ situation.
Write a Python program called ‘vehicleclassifier.py’ that can calculate the class to which a 
vehicle belong
